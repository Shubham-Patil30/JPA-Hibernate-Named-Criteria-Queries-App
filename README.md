# JPA Hibernate Queries Project

## Description
This project demonstrates the use of different types of queries in JPA and Hibernate, including named queries, named native queries, and criteria queries. It serves as a practical application to understand these query techniques for retrieving data from a database in a structured way. The project is designed for users looking to deepen their understanding of JPA and Hibernate querying capabilities.

## Features
- **Named Queries**: Predefined JPQL queries associated with an entity.
- **Named Native Queries**: SQL queries defined as part of the entity, using native SQL syntax.
- **Criteria Queries**: Dynamic and type-safe queries created programmatically using the Criteria API.

## Technologies Used
- Java
- JPA (Java Persistence API)
- Hibernate ORM
- MySQL (or any other relational database)
- Maven for dependency management

## Project Structure
- **Entity Classes**: Contains entities with named queries and named native queries defined using `@NamedQuery` and `@NamedNativeQuery`.
- **Criteria Queries**: Implemented in the DAO layer using the JPA Criteria API.
- **DAO Classes**: Provides methods to execute each type of query and return the results.

## Annotations and APIs Used
- `@NamedQuery`: Defines a JPQL query with a specific name that can be reused in code.
- `@NamedNativeQuery`: Defines a native SQL query with a name, allowing use of SQL syntax directly.
- **Criteria API**: JPA’s programmatic way to create queries, providing flexibility and type safety.

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Shubham-Patil30/JPA-Hibernate-Named-Criteria-Queries-App.git
